# DeepLearning-Crop-Disease-Identification
This deep learning project is made using Tensor-flow library and aims to
identify the crop and their respective diseases(if they exist),
the GUI is Tkinter based and is made in such a way that in just two 
clicks one may identify the disease and a recommender system suggest measures to stop further spread.
The problem statement is basically based on ISRO's SIH problem statement.
